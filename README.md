IBTrACS Archives Data Analysis Final Project
Description
This project intends to collect data and information from existing IBTrACS archives and have it cleaned and analyzed to see if there are any general trends and correlations between variables.

About the Authors
Hanna Haddad and Swati Govindaraju are both undergraduate students at UC Berkeley taking STAT 133. This project was the final project for their class.

Division of Labor

Hanna Haddad - Wrote the 'cleaning.R', 'visualization.R', 'README.md', and 'skeleton.R' files.

Swati Govindaraju - Wrote the 'analysis.R' and 'report.Rmd' files.

The Directory
There are a total of 6 files.

1.) code - this file holds all of our code ('cleaning.R', 'analysis.R', and 'visualization.R')

2.) rawdata - this file holds all of the imported raw data

3.) data - this file holds all the cleaned data

4.) resources - this file holds any resources or miscellaneous information (FB screenshot, instruction slides)

5.) report - this file holds the 'report.Rmd' and, when run, the knitted PDF.

6.) images - this file holds all of the images created to be used in the report.

Running the Files
The following shows you how to run the files in order to get the end report.

1.) Run the skeleton.R. This will create folders and move the existing .R and .Rmd files into the appropriate folders.

2.) Open the 'code' folder and run 'cleaning.R', 'analysis.R', and 'visualization.R'. This will populate the data, images, and resources folders.

3.) Open the 'report' folder and knit the 'report.Rmd' into a PDF. This will create the PDF summary of the report.

Additional Comments
None.
